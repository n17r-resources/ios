## July 2 - Lecture 6 - Intermediate Swift

#### Lecture overview:

- Optionals (force/implicit unwrapping, optional chaining, nil coalescing, type casting)
- Properties (computed, lazy, observers)
- Closures (shorthands, capturing, escaping)
- Types (structs, classes, enums, protocols + funcs, tuples)
- Protocols (first-class type, contract-like, polymorphism)
- HOF (map, filter, reduce)

### Homework - Enhanced Shop

#### Requirements:
- Use Protocols, Enums (you must logically design your shop and appropriately use protocols, enums, structs and classes)
- Use at least one HOF (higher-order functions, e.g. map, filter, reduce)
- Basic shop functionality (as from Lecture 2)
- Different payment types
- Items are now sorted by catalogs (drinks/fruits/etc) & we can request items by specific catalogs
- Items are now limited in stock (e.g. there are only 5 apples in the shop, and 7 bottles of milk)
- Cart has limited capacity (e.g. you may put just 10 items in the cart)

#### Extras:
- Different measures of items (kilograms, liters & etc)
- Multiuser (real shop, with one seller & one or more users)
- Implement any type of discount system (for ex.: if you buy 3 apples you get +1 for free)
